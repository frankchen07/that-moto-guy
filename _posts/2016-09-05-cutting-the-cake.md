title: Cutting the Cake (Lane Splitting)
updated: 2016-09-05

So what's the deal on safe lane splitting?

California has traditionally been the state that's been intentionally vague about lane splitting but only recently (fucking finally) passed a law stating that lane splitting is legal. Now, most other states and countries don't allow lane splitting, so if you looove to moto, Cali is where to go (if you don't mind the god-awful commute traffic as well). Aside from that, I hear there are really nice roads elsewhere in the world.

If you're going to split, which I hope you are, because it gets you places faster, consistently makes it look like Google Maps is overestimating your travel time, and keeps your moto and armpits nice and cool.

As I've commuted more and more, I've discovered some rulesets that I usually follow whenever it comes to lane splitting. Mind you, these are my own observations of where I feel moto-ers should avoid (or at least have a super keen spidey-sense of when cars like to give you a big warm hug, aka, crash into you.

Lane splitting when ...

traffic is at a dead stop. You're fairly safe. That doesn't mean "let's go 80 mph", but generally, cars can't just turn out in the space between lanes, because really, where the fuck are they trying to go? Into the car next to them? The real danger here is someone opening their door. Yeah, it happens.

traffic is at a dead stop and begins to move. This scenario can get dicey. This is when those lane changing knuckleheads decide "it's MAH turn, motherfuckers, to get six lanes across to the exit coming up in two seconds that I should've seen ten minutes ago but was on my phone texting my kid, who is the backseat texting me." Like I said, things get dicey. They don't shoulder check, and as they're trying to squeeze in that appearing space next to you, they jerk out of the lane like they're in full seizure, right into you. Check yourself and the spaces around you when cars start moving again.

traffic is moving slowly and there's some space in between cars in either lane. This is rugged territory. People can switch in and out of their respective lane WHENEVER THEY WANT. And into you, if you're not careful. So here's the thing at that speed. You think that going a little slower might be better, but you actually might want to go a little faster. This allows you to minimize the amount of time you're in people's blind spots. Keep your RPMs high, so you have power to GTFO. However, there is a speed sweet spot. Go too fast, and you can't react if someone pulls out. Go too slow and you could be a moto sandwich. A controversial tip is to use your high beams during the daytime so people can see you better.

there's a sacred gap. This scenario is particularly dangerous. Imagine the previous scenario - cars are tightly packed but moving, except this time, add a wiiiide open part of the lane on your right. Usually this happens when cars leave lots of space between them and the car in front, so they can coast the entire way through traffic and never stop. Good for them, they save their brake pads, zone out because they can, and coast like gangsters. Bad for you. Think about it. Open right area, crowded left area, you coming up the middle ... what's the natural response here? 50% of the time, someone in that crowded left lane is thinking they can beat everyone in traffic by switching into that open right lane spot. What they don't think about, or even look for, is you. 

I had a little incident a couple of weeks ago when a car did exactly that. A Geek Squad car (yeah, of all fucking cars) turned out super fast and before he even was able to react, I smashed into his right mirror (quite literally smashed) with the very tip of my left handlebar. It was an awful noise, and I looked back; his mirror was hanging off the side of the car. I muttered some incoherent swear words and motioned for us to move to the shoulder. I got to the shoulder, and looked behind me. No Geek Squad car. I look on the freeway, 4 lanes over in the carpool lane and there he was. The Geek Squard car with the obliterated mirror. He was moving along, and paid no attention to my hand-waving, and was far from even trying to head over. Well, whatever, Mr.Got-Hit-and-Run. I had no damages aside from a light mark on my handlebar. Fine.

Another scenario is when cars are all moving pretty fast and a moto-er just splits through all the cars going 95 mph. This is generally not recommended. Metal gets pretty pliable at those speeds. The moto-er might have a little more maneuverability, but one mistake and you're pretty much cream on the highway. I generally avoid splitting above 50-60 mph and even when I do so, it's to get by one or two really slow moving peeps. 

The lover. Those guys and gals who make really slow lane changes into you. Fast enough where it startles me and I begin reacting by moving away, but slow enough where it's not like the above got-hit-and-run scenario. These are particularly irritating. You're moving away the entire time, but the other side of your brain is screaming "HELLO? DO YOU NOT SEE THE HALF TON OF FLESH AND MOTO OVER HERE?" I usually just hold my horn while moving away. Only the bravest don't immediately jump back into their own lane.

While lane splitting, there's always going to be that car that knows you're coming and decides to just use the entire left shoulder of the highway to get away from you. Shit man. I might need an inch or two of extra space (if any, because motos are pretty thin), but you don't need to move away from me like I'm the plague. I always give these dudes and dudettes an extra peace sign of appreciation for at least watching out for us, but come on, no need to blast off like a motherfuck.

The clueless. By law, cars do not have to move for you, but they cannot block you. That being said, there's always this one segment of the road thaty ou're just stuck on because there's two cars that need to just get a goddamn room because they're waaaay to close to together and you're just unable to split. Technically, they don't have to move for you if they're still within the bounds of their lane. 

The hater. These guys will actively try and run you over. I've never encountered this but I know it exists out there. Just stay away. Take a different route, get off the same track as them. They will try and block you, run you over because of some weird sense of entitlement that you get to split lanes you don't or some weird thing they really need to work out with their therapist.

The talker. Yo, I can't hear you with my earplugs in. Yes, the moto is fast. No, I'm not going to rev it for you. Shit, man. Okay, okay, I'm not that mean. I usually respond with I'm sorry, I can't really hear you with my earplugs in.

## Typography Elements in One

Let's start with a informative paragraph. **This text is bolded.** But not this one! _How about italic text?_ Cool right? Ok, let's **_combine_** them together. Yeah, that's right! I have code to highlight, so `ThisIsMyCode()`. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so [here we go](#) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

## Code Blocks

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

## Table

### Table 1: With Alignment

## Horizontal Line

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:
