At some point, you are going to cheat on your partner with your motorcycle. 

> "Just ride me, moto says. We'll only be gone for a couple days. You'll be back before your partner knows it."

Yeah that's right. You'll be straddling your moto, feeling the pulsating rhythm carry you through a sea of beautiful forests, breathing in the sweet prickly smell of pine, and having your breath taken away by vista points. Curved roads that last forever (77 miles was the longest I've seen), no gas stations for miles - no one to disturb your little affair with the moto. You roll out at night in the brush, camping alongside your favorite machine. You rationalize your salacious decision with the promise that it won't happen next time. Don't kid yourself.

Having an escapade with your moto is no easy thing. There are things you have to think about. Things you have to prepare for. People you have to ask and/or slip by (half-kidding). 

I'm a rather minimal (read: one bag) sort of traveler, so putting together a moto pack was challenging. I wanted to be agile, yet comfortable (mostly).   There'll be some trial and error, and you'll overpack the first time for sure. But as you go on more and more escapades, you'll find that on every trip, there are things that you actually didn't need. I could be wrong; I haven't been a trip longer than a couple of days. I also haven't run into the issue of being completely screwed over in the middle of nowhere either, so I'm as seasoned as a bland fish.

My most recently trip was nice. I packed for a week and some. 3-4 days on the moto roads from the Bay Area to LA, and the other 3-4 days to Washington DC via plane from LAX. Thus, I had to pack enough clothing and whatever for about a week, in one backpack, and one tailbag. I pretty much took up all the space that was offered. I'd like to share my thought process for packing and my thought process for packing such items.

However, I still believe that even for longer trips, the bare essentials can get you by - you might even be more comfortable with leaving most of what you possess behind. 

Packing for a moto trip is somewhat of a thought process, and its much more difficult than just throwing all your shit in a car, dusting off your hands, and flipping on the TV. Space, weight, and usefulness constraints all come into play on a moto. Potential encounters and potential things that go wrong can also really sour up a trip. 

space considerations
how much space do you have and what are your preferences for riding with or without a pack?
what kind of luggage do you have? big rig with hard cases, saddlebags, tail bag, top case? 

weight considerations
are you going to be carrying another passenger?
suspension adjustments for heavier loads
different type of tires (touring tires)
moto type is less important 
passenger, suspension adjustment, tire load, moto type

usefulness constraints
no duality, everything is multi-use, probability of it being a common issue
duct tape 

Potential encounters
moto related, human related, 


Before you set off and get all oogly boogly about your trip, the primary thing you want to make sure is that your health is in excellent condition. You're the one that's going to pilot the motorcycle. You gotta stay awake, you have to have the endurance and mental strength to not fuck up. Anything other considerations before this shouldn't even matter.

Once you've got a clean bill of health, make sure your moto is up to par. If coolant is slowly leaking out and your oil is as dark as shit, your brake pads are worn out and your tire has 5 plugged holes, it's time to put spend some time and money for some moto TLC. 

Preventative maintenance
pre-moto inspection, tools, most common failures
* oil / coolant / brake flush
* brake pad replacement
* valve check
* chain check 
* tire wear / wheel alignment
* preload adjustment
* tighten & lube stuff

Scenario planning
worst case

The moto mindset
I'll fix whatever shit comes my way

## Typography Elements in One

Let's start with a informative paragraph. **This text is bolded.** But not this one! _How about italic text?_ Cool right? Ok, let's **_combine_** them together. Yeah, that's right! I have code to highlight, so `ThisIsMyCode()`. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so [here we go](#) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

## Table

### Table 1: With Alignment

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |

## Horizontal Line

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

___
