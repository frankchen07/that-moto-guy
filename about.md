I've owned and ridden motorcycles since 2011. I love riding. Since I can't ride or talk all day but can certainly write as much as I want, all the backwashed bug juice comes out here.

I write here to share things that I've learned on the back of two wheels - the fallacy and limitations of humans, the perfections and annoyances of the motorcycle machine, and all that spiritual stuff that gets poured into your chakras when you're hurling wrenches and fluids at your bike out of frustration or when you're tearing up some corners at the local mountain/track/sandbox. 

As many mothers would say, "bicycling through a city is dangerous enough, and now you want to straddle something three hundred pounds heavier, fifty times louder, and probably a two hundred times faster?"

Ya. I do.
