title: Moto Gear Review! Forcefield Pro L2K Evo Standalone Back Protector

When I first started riding, I was a big fan of "all-in-one" sort of solutions. I liked having a back protector slotted in my jacket, so I could just put a jacket on, and have guaranteed protection.

As I've advanced in my riding skills, done a few trackdays, the requirements for trackday explicitly state that a standalone back protector was necessary. I sort of thought it through, and it does make sense - a standalone back protector is directly on your back, so in the case of an accident, it doesn't shift, fall off, or protect the wrong side of you when you're sliding down the pavement or hitting awkwardly shaped things. 

Putting on race level protection everytime I ride can get a little annoying - (it makes going to places with the moto a little difficult I admit), but it goes with any type of armor I decide to buy! Therefore, track-day approved, commute approved, protection all the time, but shitty carry-around capacity.

I'm all for not dying, so I wanted:

1. race-level back protection
2. stand-alone back protector (not an insert)
3. minimum CE-2 rating
4. reusable protection (can withstand more than one hit)
5. relatively thin profile
6. comfortable
7. an easy method to carry with me when off the bike

There's a variety of on-the-back motorcycle back protectors made by varying companies. Dainese, Alpinestars, Knox, Forcefield - they all have standalone back protectors.

I went with the Forcefield brand because of the claim that their back protectors can be reused after an accident. I fortunately have not had the chance to test the back protector in any kind of accident. 

Forcefield had two main standalone back protectors - the Forcefield L2K back protector and the Forcefield Pro Sub 4 back protector. Both of them fulfilled point number 1 and 2 above. The Pro Sub 4 was much too thick for my liking, and it looked incredibly bulky under my jacket. Stuffed under there, it was puffing up my jacket so much that my armpits were a little sore after the ride. It's Pro Sub 4 because it's up to an inch thick, so the Pro Sub 4 fails point number 3.

That left the Forcefield Pro L2K Evo Standalone as the go to. It's thin, but not flimsy. It's got a nice heft to it. Adjustable straps for both the shoulder and the waist, and neither of them have given up on me just yet after a year of heavy use. 

My only gripe is that the constant on-off has caused the waist velcro to be stretched somewhat, decreasing the surface area that the velcro has the grab. I don't know if will pose issues in high-speed situations. I suspect that the back protector is not meant to be worn outside your jacket. As long as your gear is relatively form fitting, a little wear and tear from the velcro shouldn't pose a problem in a crash. 

Measure yourself, use the size guide, and get the correct size too. Too small, not enough protection, too large, and you'll have back protector sticking out of your ass.

Moto on!
