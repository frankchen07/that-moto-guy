title: Gear Review! Klim Badlands Pro Jacket

I used to own an Alpinestars textile jacket. I used it for 5-6 years with no accidents whatsoever. The stitching has started to slightly come apart, but the motorcycle jacket is still functional. However, I felt the need for an upgrade, mostly for weather reasons. For a very long time, I rode with this jacket, hidden underneath a Olympia rain jacket, and the constant wind, rain, and daily use up and down the Bay Area had shredded the Olympia jacket and left me wet, cold, in the Bay Area winters (yeah yaeh, I know we Californians are fickle and whiny when it comes to weather that is less than sunshine).

I did quite a bit of research on 4 season jackets, but the consensus came out to be that there really wasn't a jacket that could do everything that you wanted. Obviously not. But there were jackets that did many things well, and those were the ones I was looking for.

My requirements were below, and for each requirement, I'll discuss the ins and outs of my final decision and my thoughts of a year-after ownership of the Klim Badlands.

1. multi-season jacket
2. warm
3. waterproof
4. windproof
5. high-visibility
6. updated shoulder, elbow, and chest armor
7. pockets n' shit

Because no four-season jacket could absolutely do everything, I started getting in the habit of breaking down the requirements to see where I could potentially source the "best of" in other areas. 

The two biggest problems I faced when riding, weather-wise, were

1. being cold in the mornings
2. being wet when it rained, despite having a rain jacket

Being cold was two fold. I needed a windproof layer and an insulating layer. Wind robs you of precious body heat, and well cold, just makes you cold. Thus, it was apramount that the jacket ahd the ability to completely block out wind. Ideally, the jacket would aslo be warm, but this is the point when I began to think of splitting off the functionality of a motorcycle jacket. 

If you think about what motorcycle jackets are made for, armored jackets asre best at protecting one from abrasion (sliding on the ground), and hard impacts (chest, shoulder, elbow, back armor). I would say that something like rain proofing or wind proofing is an additional feature, not something that is a necessity or requirement. Therefore, by function alone, motorcycle companies, I feel, have less of an incentive to perfect that functionality. Same goes with "winter-proofing."

So separating the functionalities of what you want while riding is key to buying the right thing for you. I'll buy the motorcycle jacket that does as many things as it can well, keeping in mind quality, function, and convenience. Things like windproofing, waterproofing, and warmth, however, might be done better by non-motorcycle brands - Marmot, etc. 

That leads us to an example of how one might layer for functionality on a motorcycle. Usually, windproof and waterproof functionalities went together, so I actually looked into sailing jackets as the outermost layer. The layer underneath was the motorcycle layer. Armor, abrasion resistance, the whole she-bang. Below that, mountaineering gear that's designed to retain and circulate body heat. The convenience trade-off played out here though. That meant I was putting on a minimum of three jackets, not to mention insulating layer. So I thought, why don't we combine the functionality into the most minimal setup that I could think of?

That meant not necessarily the absolute best functionality in each category, but a mixed and matched, quality, proven combination of functionality catered to motorcyclists. Put shortly, I started looking for a shell that was an armored motorcycle jacket, waterproof, and windproof. Therefore, I was looking for a motorcycle jacket that was an effective outer layer shell. 

I opted for a motorcycle jacket that had a strong, durable outer layer that was windproof, waterproof, highly visible and had great protection. A shell, essentially. Klim's product fit the bill, although I did take a hard look at all of the other major brands as well (Alpinestars, Dainese, Rukka, Held, Aerostitch, even BMW and Triumph). It came down to the fact that I wanted to custom separate the functionality of my motorcycle gear. Obviously the armor and abrasion resistance should be in one package. But seeing as convenience was also an issue, it would be nice if it were waterproof and windproof as well. I feel like I would have actually opted for the plastic PVC kind of raincoats that don't absorb any kind of water whatsoever, but no motorcycle manufacturer actually produces jackets of that sort. If I separated the the waterproof and windproof function of the jacket, it was just one more jacket I had to zip up and wear over my other motorcycle gear. So, what's waterproof and windproof and also is on a motorcycle jacket? Goretex gear. I opted for a goretex durable shell, which allows flexibility under the hood, allowing me to increase or decrease layers as I saw fit. This to me, was the most adaptable. 

1. Combined with the rationale above, I needed a jacket that was impenetrable to the elements. That mostly means high winds and lots of rain and moisture. That eliminates leather. That doesn't eliminate "rain jackets with a PVC coating," but experience dictates that the coating has the ability to flake off, so I wasn't too much into that either. PVC raincoats could work, but they "don't breathe" (which was fine), but they weren't exactly armor compliant. 

2. Use mountaineering gear that is developed to help mountaineers stay warm

3. Waterproof nothings every "waterproof" - goretex still hasn't let me down just yet

4. windproof layers, and goretex

5. high-visibility

6. definition of motorcycle armor
