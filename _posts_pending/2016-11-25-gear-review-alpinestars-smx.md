This is the first set of "above the ankle" boots that I have owned in my motorcycling career. Before that I had the Alpinestars SMX-1s, which were technically a riding shoe - with only slight ankle coverage, but nothing above the shin. Those were a relatively impulse buy, based on the fact that I hated wearing boots that extended all the way up the shin. 

My assumptions were wrong, as I now implore every new rider to go and get fitted for motorcycle boots that protect all the way up to the shin. Ideally, you'd like the boot to cover maybe 30-40% of your leg from the bottom up, and your knee and shin guards (from your motorcycle pants) to cover the rest 60-70%. Ideally. My body structure allows around 90% coverage of my leg. 

With any motorcycle boot, there are several important things.

1. fit
2. motorcycle-oriented boot
3. shin protection
4. ankle protection
5. twist and shear protection
6. sturdy construction

Most legit manufacturers make good boots, and sometimes it's as easy as reading reviews. I opt for trackday or adventure-level protection, as either of these two endeavors will be cross functional enough for the street. 

Now I'll say this again and again. Find the boot in real life and try the brand, model, and several different sizes with socks that work well in both hot and cold weather. Preferably a thin wool sock. I say this because the fit will have to be spot on. Boots don't mean shit if they just come flying off when you get into an accident. They also don't mean shit if your toes are cramped as hell, and you can't feel your shifters and brakes.

Motorcycle gear manufacturers, for the most part, know what they're doing. Don't try and pass off construction boots or fashionable Italian leather boots for motorcycling boots. I've seen it. Those boots are not meant to withstand 300 pounds of crushing and shearing force on your leg when you're sliding down the highway on your ass, and your leg is trapped under your motorcycle. You'll be glad that your boots are sturdy, abrasion-resistant, and stiff enough to prevent your ankle from being torn apart. 

That leads me to my next point. Shin protection, ankle protection, and twisting protection. A nice hard piece of material near the shin helps to buffer impacts on your leg. Some boots will have hard ankle protection, but usually it's not your ankle that gets slammed. It's the side of your feet. So, protection on the side of your ankle bones, as well as protection that helps to prevent extreme twisting of your leg.
