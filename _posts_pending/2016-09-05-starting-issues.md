## Title Issues

**Below outlines the route a seller would have to take to officially sell a motorcycle with a lien on it.**

1. Whoever owns the loan to the lienholder of the title needs to pay off the loan.
2. Title holder receives the embossed lien release.
3. Title holder receives the old title from the lienholder (bank/financial institution).
4. Title holder takes the embossed lien release and the old title and gets a new title; title should be clean- no liens, no loans, and in the title holder's name.
5. Title holder sells the bike, title signed by name on the title, in person, along with a signed bill of sale to the buyer. 

**What happens if the title holder only presents an old title, with a embossed lien release?** 

1. Call bank institution to confirm the lien release.

**Potential Scenarios:**

1. Buyer has to take the old title and embossed lien release to the DMV get the new title, and return to the original title holder to get the new title signed (bad...original title holder may not sign it).

2. Buyer would have to get a notarized power of attorney to state that once the buyer get the new title, he/she has the power to make it into his/her own name (better...no need to return to the owner).

3. Simply wait until the owner gets the new title, and signs it (best).

## Dealing with Dealerships

1. Negotiating the OTD (out the door) price is king.

**Possible Fees Involved.**

1. Bike registration (varies). 
2. Title transfer ($15).
3. Taxes (varies).
4. Documentation Fee (varies, cost of standing in line at the DMV).

---

## Potential Combinations of Documentation.

1. Clean title
    * Owner signs the middle
    * Mileage written in by owner
    * Owner signs the lienholder part at the bottom
    * Frank fills in the top part on the back
2. Bill of sale, signed by owner.
3. Vehicle/Vessel Transfer and Reassignment Form

1. Old title, signed by owner.
2. Embossed lien release, proof of no loans or liens, call to check.
3. Notarized power of attorney (DMV Vehicle/Vessel Transfer and Reassignment Form) for transferring the title. 
4. DMV Application for Duplicate Title, in case it's electronic.
5. Bill of sale, signed by owner.

## Typography Elements in One

Let's start with a informative paragraph. **This text is bolded.** But not this one! _How about italic text?_ Cool right? Ok, let's **_combine_** them together. Yeah, that's right! I have code to highlight, so `ThisIsMyCode()`. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so [here we go](#) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

## Code Blocks

```javascript

No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

## Table

### Table 1: With Alignment

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

### Table 2: With Typography Elements

Markdown | Less | Pretty

## Horizontal Line

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

___
