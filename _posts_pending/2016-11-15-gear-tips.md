title: The Rules of Gear

Couple of gear rules that I like to follow. 

1. Don't buy anything you don't absolutely love.

2. Save if you have to, in order to not break rule number one. At a minimum, something you _like_ is necessary.

3. There is the correct gear for the correct time, but try and buy pieces that multi-task, or at least separate them as functional pieces.

4. Quality over quantity. Quality over quantity. Quality over quantity.



General thinking about pieces of gear





When it came to gear, I was a dumbass. I got the padded and armored jacket, great helmet, but no leg or foot protection. Good work, you big amateur. Let's completely forget the fact that your legs are probably 50% of your body, and jeans nowadays are made of cotton, and people sleep and shit in cotton, nevermind some hearty, abrasive scraping down the freeway. Gear from head to toe is recommended. 

Jagged areas of your body are important.

Your head is obviously important. What else is jagged on your body? Elbows, shoulders, knees, hips, ankles and feet. They're the ones that are going to get scraped AND banged up in a crash. 

Everything else? Abrasion resistance. Keep your skin intact.

I'm not going to go into the debate between leather and textile (which includes cordura, goretex, and other synthetic creations), everyone knows how to read reviews and use Google. Generally speaking, both can work. Buy quality, and you won't have an issue. 

I enjoy sets, quality pieces of gear that goes well in a multitude of scenarios.






Things you might have to think about. Mesh, winter lining, wet weather protection? 






The best piece of gear is your brain. That way, you won't even need to use the gear you're wearing, because you get home safely.

> This is Markdown Cheatsheet Demo for **The Plain**, this Jekyll theme. Please check the raw content of this file for the markdown usage.

## Typography Elements in One

Let's start with a informative paragraph. **This text is bolded.** But not this one! _How about italic text?_ Cool right? Ok, let's **_combine_** them together. Yeah, that's right! I have code to highlight, so `ThisIsMyCode()`. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so [here we go](#) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

<div class="divider"></div>

## Headings H1 to H6

# H1 Heading

## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

#### H4 Heading

##### H5 Heading

###### H6 Heading

<div class="divider"></div>

## Footnote

Let's say you have text that you want to refer with a footnote, you can do that too! This is an example for the footnote number one [^1]. You can even add more footnotes, with link! [^2]

<div class="divider"></div>

## Blockquote

> Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible. --Francis of Assisi

**NOTE:** This theme does NOT support nested blockquotes.

<div class="divider"></div>

## List Items

1. First order list item
2. Second item

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

<div class="divider"></div>

## Code Blocks

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

<div class="divider"></div>

## Table

### Table 1: With Alignment

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

### Table 2: With Typography Elements

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

<div class="divider"></div>

## Horizontal Line

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

___
