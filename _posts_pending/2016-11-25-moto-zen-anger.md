moto-post: who I was

moto-ing highlights the qualities that are found within a particular person

when you are angry, you moto angry; when you're calm and zen, you roll with the punches, and problem solve

with moto-ing, I see that there are some levels that you can achieve when it comes to flow and the zen art of moto-ing. Now, this isn't some woo-woo yoga shit I'm trying to impose on you (not saying yoga is woo-woo), but in essence you can be the moto guy who is pissed off at everything and everyone on the road, flips the birds as frequently as he or she exhales, or you can be the moto guy / gal that doesn't REALLY let anything phase him/her. 

A nice method of coping that I like to implement is to react first to get out of danger, and then *friendly wave* (or *peace sign*) whatever you want, regardless of the situation. One must understand that you are on a vehicle that is far smaller and lighter than any car. It doesn't matter what it is. Porsche, some small BMW Z3 - against a motorcycle, you will lose. It will do you well to not piss off all the moving weapons on the road. 

You have nothing to gain, and everything to lose. You have control and speed, but the other party being pissed off and specifically targeting you is always something that could happen. Luckily most accidents and bumps and altercations on the road are not backed by malicious intent, but rather simple mistakes by distracted people. Still, if someone gives you space while lane splitting, or cuts you off, or flips you the bird, I give a friendly wave. In the first situation, I'm thanking them. In the second situation, even through they were in the wrong, I wave anyway. In the third situation, a friendly wave really diffuses the situation. Sometimes people just want to see the world burn (want to run moto-ers over), but by reactiing poorly, you're only putting yourself at risk. Defuse the situation, be grateful that you're on two wheels and have the temperament of a monk. Pay no attention to the overweight, annoyed person blowing their fuses in their cagey vehicle. Give them a friendly wave. 

If you're lane splitting, cars don't have to let you pass. On my commute one day, I saw a motorcyclist splitting - he had to slow down to get through an especially tight spot. He promptly revved his engine loudly, sped past the offending car, slowed down and reverse pumped his fist in the air (signaling, up yours, motherfucker). I'm over here in the back, chopping along at a nice pace and silently thinking to myself, why? I pass the offending car, and give it a friendly wave. Hopefully that makes up for some of the wtf factor on the highways. Cars don't have to let you pass. What happens if the guy driving the car was just as rage-induced as the motorcyclist? I nice tap on the accelerator and a shift to the starboard side can kill a motorcyclist. And for what? You had to fucking wait 5 extra seconds. Come on.

I share these stories in the hopes of instilling a more patient, calm, and zen-like behavior to your everyday ride. We're already a minority population on the road. That means there's less of us, and with less of us on the road, bias and extrapolations can run wild. If all motorcycles rev their engines loudly and reverse fist pump, it's going to become the standard that all motorcyclists are assholes, when that is far from the truth.

React. Be good at moto-ing. Then, friendly wave. :D

So, how does all of this relate to your temperament in your life? Hopefully these types of habits on the moto transfers to how you act and react to things that happen. 


who was I when I first considered it

it was a bit heart wrenching to see the bike go - I was moving to New York. I thought I would never ride again. 

what did I become while I was doing it

who am I now?

## Typography Elements in One

Let's start with a informative paragraph. **This text is bolded.** But not this one! _How about italic text?_ Cool right? Ok, let's **_combine_** them together. Yeah, that's right! I have code to highlight, so `ThisIsMyCode()`. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so [here we go](#) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

## Table

### Table 1: With Alignment

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

### Table 2: With Typography Elements

Markdown | Less | Pretty

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

## Horizontal Line

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

___
